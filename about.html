                    I'm a 22 year old engineering student who recently graduated from the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. This has also been my hometown.
                    <br>Since getting into programming in high school, I've always had an interest in robotics and thus studied engineering - specialising in mechatronics.
                    <br>Without this exposure I would have likely gone to instead study physics, and specialised in quantum physics.
                    <br>During my studies, I was also exposed to applications of engineering within the medical industry. The possibility of giving people more independence, was what stood out to me.
                </p>
                <p>I currently have one cat, who's name is Neko. He enjoy's belly rubs (only from me) and also bites my arms if I don't give him attention - a reasonable price to pay.</p>
