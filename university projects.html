                <h2>PLC Elevator</h2>
                <p>Goal of this project was to get model PLC controlled elevators to operate similarly to real elevators.<br>
                This included accounting for the demand on each floor to try minimise the wait time for users.</p>
                <p>Below are snippets of the code used.</p>

                <p>Visualised in Processing, as Arduino didn't have a method to plot x,y data. This required using serial communication from the microcontroller to the desktop.
                <br>Method for detecting weights was based on comparing a group of points collected by the bottom-most sensor.
                <br>If the points collected were consistent for the appearance of a weight, then it would be indicated by a yellow square.
                <br>Obstacles were detected based on both sensors measuring the same output, and indicated by a red dot.
