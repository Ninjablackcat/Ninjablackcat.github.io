                    <p>
                        Goal of this project was to get model PLC controlled elevators to operate similarly to real elevators.<br>
                        This included accounting for the demand on each floor to try minimise the wait time for users.
                    </p>
                    <p>Below are snippets of the code used.</p>

                    <h2>Robocup</h2>
                    <p>
                        My primary objective for the robot was developing the navigation method for the robot. The robot would navigate around an arena with walls as obstacles, and metal weights as "points" to be collected.
                        <br>An ultrasonic sensor array was used to collect the data, as they had sufficient range to see obstacles ahead, and were more accurate than the IR sensors available - which had even longer range.
                        <br>At the time I was intending to essentually build a map of the arena while collecting data points. Thus observing to the other side of the arena would be redundant, especially with the opponents robot also in the arena.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="webpage images/university projects/Robocup sensor array.jpg" alt="Ultrasonic sensor array, rotated by servos." width="800">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        One main challenge was that the supplied code for the ultrasonic sensors was "blocking" - that is, the microcontroller could not do any tasks until the ultrasonic sensor would return a response.
                        <br>Given that the sensors had a maximum range of 4m - resulting in a total travel distance of 8 meters for the signal - each measurement could take up to 23ms.
                        <br>While most of the obstacles are fairly large, one could do significantly larger changes in angle with the servos when rotating the sensor arrays.

                        <br>I was not aware of any methods such as a grid map at the time, so I was limiting the amount of data points collected to 2000.
                        <br>Then using a circular buffer to overwrite old data points. This ensured that the amount of time to process the data for the robot's direction of travel would not impact it's performance.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visualised in Processing, as Arduino didn't have a method to plot x,y data. This required using serial communication from the microcontroller to the desktop.
                        <br>Method for detecting weights was based on comparing a group of points collected by the bottom-most sensor.
                        <br>If the points collected were consistent for the appearance of a weight, then it would be indicated by a yellow square.
                        <br>Obstacles were detected based on both sensors measuring the same output, and indicated by a red dot.
                        <br>Robot forward direction indicated by the blue line from the white dot.

                    <h2>Wacky Races</h2>
                    <p>This required the use of data sheets to determine which components required which pins of the microcontroller chip, power, ground ect.
                    To ensure easy debugging, essentially any possible wire going to different parts of the board was given its own testpad to ensure easy debugging. This also included every ground trace to different components.
                    <br>This paid off as compared to the other pair within our group working on the "wacky hat", who only used a few test pads.
                    They found it a hassle to try and debug their board later and admitted that they should have done the same thing, despite it initially being a group joke during the process.

                    <br>
                    <p>The schematic for the PCB layout was then produced. While there is no right way to construct the PCB - just that the microcontroller and a few of the required components had specific spots for pasting later on.
                    There are several aspects to try optimise. For example to reduce noise, any transitions between planes should be as close to the pins of the connecting devices.
                    Sometimes this is not achieveable, so any high frequency signals need to have a higher priority for this instead. It is a very careful balancing act.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>The final PCB that was produced had a lot of things shifted around to allow for as much flexibility as possible. This was in case we wanted to implement any "dastardly stuff" within the rules of the competition.
                    While we didn't end up implementing any such things, it allowed for the maximum potential use of the board.
                    </p>
                    <img src="webpage images/university projects/Final Racer PCB.png" alt="Final Racer PCB.">
                    <p> Once the PCB was ordered and arrived, all of the components needed to be added to the board. This was done using a pick and place machine, and then soldered where required.
                    </p>
                    <p>There was one key issue with the board that required rework. The major one being that the nSleep pin of the PWM H-bridge for driving the motors was connected to ground.
                    This was originally connected to the microcontroller, however we were advised on our initial submission of the board that we should instead be able to change whether power is supplied to the chip, and connect nSleep to ground.
                    This mistake required lifting the nSleep leg off of the PCB, which caused it to break. We managed to somehow get around this by soldering a wire where the leg was, and by luck it managed to stay powered.
                    This was up until the competition day, where when transitioning from a platform to a rotating plank, the racer fell off, and the solder broke off. It then refused to resolder to the chip.
                    Overall this was a very fun project though even with it's challenges.
